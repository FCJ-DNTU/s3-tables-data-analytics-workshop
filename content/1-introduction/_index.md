### 1. Introduction 

#### What is Amazon S3?  

**Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)** is a leading object storage service known for its scalability, high availability, and strong security. It supports diverse use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backups, disaster recovery, and big data analytics.  

#### What are Amazon S3 Tables?  

![s3-tables](/images/1-introduction/image-1.png)  

**Amazon S3 Tables** introduce the first cloud object storage solution with built-in support for **[Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/)**. S3 Tables streamline storing and managing structured, tabular data at scale, offering significant optimization and performance enhancements.  

#### How Amazon S3 Tables Work  

- **Purpose-Built Storage for Tabular Data**  
  S3 Tables are specifically designed for storing structured data in the **Apache Parquet** format, providing better data organization and analytics performance.  

- **Automated Data Optimization**  
  S3 Tables automatically optimize stored data by compacting Parquet objects. This compaction process enhances query performance and reduces storage costs.  

#### Benefits of Amazon S3 Tables  

- **Outstanding Scalability**  
  Simplify data lake management at any scale, from small projects to operating thousands of tables in Iceberg environments.  

- **Enhanced Performance**  
  Achieve up to **3x faster query speeds** through continuous table optimization compared to unmanaged Iceberg tables, and up to **10x higher transaction throughput** than Iceberg tables stored in standard S3 buckets.  

- **Fully Managed Service**  
  Automatically handles maintenance tasks such as **compaction**, snapshot management, and removing unreferenced files to optimize query efficiency and long-term costs.  

- **Seamless Integration**  
  Leverage advanced Iceberg analytics capabilities with familiar AWS services like **Amazon Athena**, **Redshift**, and **EMR**, while maintaining compatibility with popular open-source tools.  

- **Simplified Security**  
  Manage tables as first-class AWS resources, allowing you to easily apply permissions and govern access securely.

#### Key Components of S3 Tables  

1. **Table Buckets**: Special S3 buckets designed to store analytical data, supporting Iceberg-managed tables with various schemas.  
2. **Tables**: Structured datasets organized in table buckets. These tables include features like automatic compaction, unreferenced file cleanup, and snapshot management.  
3. **Namespaces**: Logical groupings of tables within a bucket, enabling efficient data organization and classification.  

#### AWS Glue Data Catalog  

[**AWS Glue Data Catalog**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/serverless-etl-aws-glue/aws-glue-data-catalog.html#:~:text=The%20AWS%20Glue%20Data%20Catalog,formats%2C%20schemas%2C%20and%20sources.) serves as a centralized metadata repository that stores information about data locations, schemas, and runtime parameters. Acting as an index, it simplifies querying and can be registered as a data source in **Lake Formation**.  

Glue Data Catalog seamlessly integrates **table buckets, namespaces, and tables** into metadata objects, making data management efficient and user-friendly.
